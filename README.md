This contains the full Python Cheat Game. All levels inclusive.
# This is the Read Me file for the Python game.
# Which is serving as the instructions too for playing the game.
# Hope you'll enjoy it :)
# This game was written in Python 2.7.
# Thus it's a terminal game.
# The GUI version is been worked upon.
# It can be run on all OS having Python installed. Either Python 2.7 or later

# The first Python programme to run is the 'initimport.py'
# There are 2 ways to run this.

1. After downling the 'tar' file.
	Extract it to a specific folder or desktop
	Go into the extracted folder
	If you're using Linux, right click and select open in terminal
	Then type "python initimport.py"
	Without the quotes.
	Bingo, you're good to go.

2. All other OS like Windows, Mac Os among others.
	Kindly make sure you've Python installed as said earlier on.
	Navigate to the folder where you've done the extraction.
	Open your terminal or power shell. 
	Input 'python'
	Now type 'initimport.py' without the quotes.
	Bingo, you're good to go.
